# WDD3500
This is an example Flask app to help beginners learn the basics of Flask. Flask is a python micro framework which means you must have python installed on your computer. 
Before you can use Flask you must have it installed.
To install Flask you need to have pip installed. If you don't have pip installed, download the get-pip.py file then open your terminal (commnd prompt, Git Bash, etc.) and type 
```
python get-pip.py
```
Once pip is installed, you can install Flask by typeing
```
pip install Flask
```
